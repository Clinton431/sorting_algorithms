Sorting algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science and are used to rearrange a collection of items into a particular order. The efficiency of sorting algorithms is often described using Big O notation, which provides insight into the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm as the input size grows.

Here are some key points about sorting algorithms and Big O notation based on the information from the search results:

#### Sorting Algorithms
- Sorting algorithms are methods used to organize and arrange elements in a specific order, such as numerical or lexicographical order.
- Common sorting algorithms include Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort, each with its own approach and efficiency characteristics.

#### Big O Notation
- Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. In the context of algorithms, it is used to analyze the worst-case time complexity as the input size grows.
- It provides a way to compare the efficiency of algorithms and understand how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases.

#### Time Complexity of Sorting Algorithms
- The time complexity of sorting algorithms is often expressed using Big O notation. For example, the best, average, and worst-case time complexities of sorting algorithms are commonly denoted using Big O notation.
- Different sorting algorithms have different time complexities. For example, Quick Sort and Merge Sort have an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n), while Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort have an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2).

In summary, sorting algorithms are essential for organizing data, and their efficiency is often analyzed using Big O notation, which provides valuable insights into their time complexity as the input size grows.
